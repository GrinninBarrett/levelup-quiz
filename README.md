# LevelUp Quiz 📝

This is an application built while going through the [Svelte For Beginners](https://levelup.video/tutorials/svelte-for-beginners) course on Level Up Tutorials, taught by [Scott Tolinski](https://github.com/stolinski). Its purpose is to learn and practice the fundamentals of the front-end JavaScript framework [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

I followed the tutorial fairly closely, only making changes as necessary. Given the tutorial is several years old now, there have been updates that required I amend some of the code.
